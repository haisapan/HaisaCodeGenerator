# HaisaCodeGenerator
this is a code generator using Asp.net razor

When developing some software, we have to write some codes which we created before, as them have small different, Even some projects are similar with small changes, like project name, logo, title, and so on.

Let's clear up this hard work to copy/paste then modify. Using the code generator  generate code fastly and easily.

This project is part of .NET4 and visual studio 2013.

I will add more later, <b>Comming Soon...</b>

#solution:
Some code generator tools need you to install them, but this one don't need.

You can use the Visual Studio as the generator tool, which have intellisense, code map/style and so many easy functions...
